Scripts for handling Amazon Dash Button presses. The MAC addresses seen here are for my personal dash devices, so replace them with your own MAC addresses if you wish to clone/fork or otherwise use this repo.

This app uses the node-dash-button module, inspired by [this fantastic article by Edward Bensen](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8).
